You are an expert B2B website conversion strategist + information architect + enterprise UX copywriter.

Context:
I already have a clean website. I’m targeting Moroccan SMEs and medium/large organizations (not cafés/restaurants). My offer is practical AI + automation + digital performance. I want the site to feel premium, structured, “safe”, and execution-focused.

Task:
Define the full website page map and for EACH page:
- purpose (what buyer question it answers)
- ideal section order
- what each section should contain (headline + short copy + bullets)
- what proof/trust to include
- primary CTA + secondary CTA
- notes on tone (enterprise-safe, no hype)
- keep layout minimal; reuse existing design system; do not redesign.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Avoid vague claims (“revolutionary”, “cutting-edge”).
- Every page must include micro-credibility: process, timelines, deliverables, or metrics (placeholders allowed).
- Structure services by OUTCOME, not tools.
- Use a “risk-reduction funnel”: clarity → safety → proof → action.
- Morocco-friendly: optionally mention WhatsApp as a channel, but keep it professional.
- Keep each section compact: 1 headline, 1 short paragraph, 3–6 bullets max.
- If I lack real case studies, propose “Pilot examples” placeholders with realistic metrics format (e.g., response time, conversion, hours saved).

Deliverable format:
1) Site Map (list all pages in best order)
2) For each page, output a blueprint using this template:

PAGE: [Name]
Goal:
Primary audience & intent:
Primary CTA:
Secondary CTA:
Sections (in order):
  1) [Section name]
     - Headline:
     - 1–2 sentence copy:
     - Bullets (3–6):
     - Proof/Trust element:
     - CTA (if any):
  2) ...
SEO/Content notes (optional):
Design notes (minimal, reuse existing components):

Pages to include (use these unless you strongly recommend removing one):
- Home
- Services (overview)
- Service Detail Pages (one per offer bucket)
- Case Studies / Results
- How We Work (process)
- Insights / Resources
- About
- Contact / Request Pilot
- FAQ (objection handling)
- Security & Data Handling (enterprise trust)
- Legal pages: Privacy Policy + Terms

Offer buckets (use these exact categories and build pages around them):
1) Automation Systems (internal workflows, support triage, reporting automation)
2) Conversion & Growth (landing pages, funnels, tracking, experimentation)
3) Data Visibility (dashboards, KPIs, analytics setup)

Make the plan opinionated: recommend what to keep minimal, what to highlight, and what NOT to include.

Ask me ONLY ONE question at the end if absolutely necessary; otherwise make reasonable assumptions.

Now create the full blueprint.
