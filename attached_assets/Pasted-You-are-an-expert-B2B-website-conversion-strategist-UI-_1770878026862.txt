You are an expert B2B website conversion strategist + UI/UX copywriter.

Goal: Re-arrange my existing clean website sections (keep the same design system and components as much as possible) into a B2B “risk-reduction funnel” that sells to SMEs + medium/large organizations.

Do NOT redesign from scratch. Focus on:
- section order
- section titles
- copy structure (headlines, subheadlines, bullets)
- CTAs
- trust signals
Keep it minimal and premium.

Target audience:
- Decision makers (Marketing/Operations/IT/Founder) in Morocco
- Medium + growing companies, not cafes/restaurants
Main buyer concerns:
- risk, predictability, timelines, ROI, credibility, process

Primary positioning (use this exact structure, adjust words only slightly):
Headline formula: “We help [industry/companies] [outcome] using practical AI + automation.”
Subheadline: “Fast, measurable pilots → reliable implementation → long-term optimization.”

Primary CTA (top and bottom): “Request a 14-Day Pilot”
Secondary CTA: “Get a Free 5-Point Audit”

Required final section order (use this exact sequence):
1) HERO (clear positioning + 1 sentence credibility + primary/secondary CTA)
2) PROBLEM (3–5 pain bullets that organizations feel)
3) APPROACH / PROCESS (4 steps: Audit → 14-Day Pilot → Implementation → Optimization)
4) PROOF (case studies / before-after / metrics; if missing, create “pilot examples” placeholders)
5) OFFERS (group services by OUTCOME, not tech: Automation / Conversion / Data visibility)
6) TRUST (security basics, documentation, contract clarity, support/maintenance, delivery timeline)
7) ABOUT (operator tone: mission, why we exist, why we’re safe to work with; short)
8) CTA (repeat: Request Pilot + Audit)

Instructions:
- Identify my current sections and map them into the order above.
- If any section is missing, create a minimal section with placeholder content that fits the design.
- Rewrite copy to be concise, enterprise-safe, and measurable (avoid hype words like “revolutionary”).
- Keep each section small: max 1 headline, 1 short paragraph, 3–6 bullets, 1 CTA (only where relevant).
- Add “micro-proof” everywhere: numbers, timelines, deliverables (even if placeholders).
- Use Morocco-friendly wording: emphasize WhatsApp as an optional communication channel, but keep it professional.

Output:
1) A clear list: “Old sections → New order mapping”
2) Final
